Similar to how I loaded csv's into the Oracle SQL developer that I used last semester, this program was very easy to use and the ability to see how the data will look while you load it in leads to less mistakes and repetition of teh same step to make sure it's right. The lab procedure was very helpful so I didnt experience any challenges when uploading. </blockquote>"

When working with this part of the lab it all really made sense to me. this is probably becuase i have already worked with SQL before and have a good understanding on how it works and what to do while using it. The only challenge I encountered was that looking back at the Team_Locations field the dataset did not include the Team_ID field so I wasnt able to set that as the forign key for the other table and setting it as the priary key of that table. Otherwise, this portion of the lab was really easy to understand and helped me get a grasp on the DB Browser.</blockquote>"
